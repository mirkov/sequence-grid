#+title: ~sequence-grids~ package

* Introduction

  Functions in this package create 1-dimensional grids holding
  sequences of numbers as specified by some mathematical rules.  The
  functions are a thin veneer over Liam Healy's ~grid~ package from
  his ~antik~ library.

  There are two main sequence types:
  - sequences of evenly spaced integers
  - sequences of real numbers
    
    
  The integer sequences can store integers in various representations:
   bytes, integers, and floats.

  The real number sequences always store the numbers as floats.

* ~grid-sequences~ dictionary

** *ci-seq*, sequences of consecutive integers

*** Syntax
    - *ci-seq* kind count &key len step type

*** Arguments and values
    - /kind/ - a keyword specifying the type of sequence
    - /count/ - a positive integer
    - /len/ - a symbol
    - /type/ - a symbol
    - /step/ - a positive integer

*** Description

    CI-SEQ generates a 1-D grid storing a sequence of consecutive
    integers, such as 0, 1, 2, ... COUNT-1.  COUNT determines the
    number of integers.  STEP specifies the difference between
    successive integers.  KIND determines the type of number that the
    grid will store.  KIND can be one of
    - /:CONSTANT/ All grid elements store the same integer
    - /:INTEGER/ Grid is of type integer storing values 0, 1, etc 
    - /:COUNT/ Grid is of type *signed* byte storing values 0, 1, etc
    - /:NATURAL/ Grid of type signed byte storing values 1, 2, etc
    - /:FLOAT/ Grid is of floating type storing values 0, 1, .  /TYPE/
      can be ~float~ or ~double-float~
    - /:COMPLEX/ Grid is of complex type storing values 0, 1, .
      /TYPE/ can be ~float~ or ~double-float~


    /ci-seq/ is a generic function with methods selected on /kind/.
    All of the methods use grid's /map-grid/.


** *progression*, general sequences of numbers

*** Syntax
    - *progression* type begin end &key count

*** Arguments and values
    - /type/ - a keyword
    - /begin/ - a number
    - /end/ - a number
    - /count/ - a positive integer

*** Description
    PROGRESSION generates a sequence of numbers between BEGIN and END
    in some kind of progression, such as linear or geometric
    (exponential).

    TYPE determines the progression type.  Allowed values for TYPE are
    - :linear
    - :geometric
    - (:power, not implemented yet)
    - (:logarithmic, not implemented yet)
      

* To-do
  - Extend /ci-seq/ with the /step/ keyword to allow for sequences
    such as 1 3 5
