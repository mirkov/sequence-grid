	* setup.lisp: Renamed constants *v0*, *v1*, and *v2* into +v0+,
	+v1+, and +v2+

	* integer-sequences.lisp (ci-seq): Changed keyword argument names
	from LEN to BITS.  I eliminated TYPE keyword that was used for
	float and complex kinds.  There, I use *default-element-type* to
	determine storage.

	* sequence-grid-package-def.lisp (#:sequence-grid): Shadowing
	iterate's ``rotate''.  It conflicts with antik's.  This may be an
	internal antik issue.

	* integer-sequences.lisp (ci-seq): For :float and :complex kinds,
	I use *default-element-type* to specify the float type

	* float-sequences.lisp (linear, progression): Renamed test
	``linear'' into ``progression''.  I now test only for progression
	contents using cl:array.  

	* sequence-grid-package-def.lisp: (defpackage): removed explicit
	dependency on :grid
	(antik:make-user-package): Calling it with :sequence-grid to
	install shadowing symbols

	* setup.lisp: Using antik/grid *default-grid-type* and
	*default-element-type* instead of *array-type* and *float-type*.
	I renamed *integer-type* into *default-integer-type*.
	* float-sequences.lisp: Same comment as for setup.lisp above.
	* integer-sequences.lisp: Same comment as for setup.lisp above.

	* sequence-grid.asd (#:sequence-grid): Renamed file and asdf system.

	* integer-sequences.lisp (ci-seq): Added constant integer sequence
	type
	(ci-seq)<constant>: I set the default value of LEN to 1.
	Otherwise I was getting coerce errors

	* float-sequences.lisp: Added basic tests

	* integer-sequences.lisp: Added basic tests

	* setup.lisp (*integer-type*): Copied definition from the old and
	obsolete mv-grid-utils package
